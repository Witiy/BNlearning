/**
 * Iterator for maps of type int and double.
 * <p>
 * <p>The iterator semantics for Trove's primitive maps is slightly different
 * from those defined in <tt>java.util.Iterator</tt>, but still well within
 * the scope of the pattern, as defined by Gamma, et al.</p>
 * <p>
 * <p>This iterator does <b>not</b> implicitly advance to the next entry when
 * the value at the current position is retrieved.  Rather, you must explicitly
 * ask the iterator to <tt>advance()</tt> and then retrieve either the <tt>key()</tt>,
 * the <tt>value()</tt> or both.  This is done so that you have the option, but not
 * the obligation, to retrieve keys and/or values as your application requires, and
 * without introducing wrapper objects that would carry both.  As the iteration is
 * stateful, access to the key/value parts of the current map entry happens in
 * constant time.</p>
 * <p>
 * <p>In practice, the iterator is akin to a "search finger" that you move from
 * position to position.  Read or graph operations affect the current entry only and
 * do not assume responsibility for moving the finger.</p>
 * <p>
 * <p>Here are some sample scenarios for this class of iterator:</p>
 * <p>
 * <pre>
 * // accessing keys/values through an iterator:
 * for ( TIntDoubleIterator it = map.iterator(); it.hasNext(); ) {
 *   it.advance();
 *   if ( satisfiesCondition( it.key() ) {
 *     doSomethingWithValue( it.value() );
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * <pre>
 * // modifying values in-place through iteration:
 * for ( TIntDoubleIterator it = map.iterator(); it.hasNext(); ) {
 *   it.advance();
 *   if ( satisfiesCondition( it.key() ) {
 *     it.setValue( newValueForKey( it.key() ) );
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * <pre>
 * // deleting entries during iteration:
 * for ( TIntDoubleIterator it = map.iterator(); it.hasNext(); ) {
 *   it.advance();
 *   if ( satisfiesCondition( it.key() ) {
 *     it.remove();
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * <pre>
 * // faster iteration by avoiding hasNext():
 * TIntDoubleIterator iterator = map.iterator();
 * for ( int thread = map.size(); thread-- > 0; ) {
 *   iterator.advance();
 *   doSomethingWithKeyAndValue( iterator.key(), iterator.value() );
 * }
 * </pre>
